The Nexodus project runs a demo service at [try.nexodus.io](https://try.nexodus.io).

> ***Note***: This demo service should not be used for any production purposes. All demo users are placed in the same demo organization, meaning all of these hosts will be visible to each other. Choose what you connect to the demo service accordingly.

## Users and Authentication

The demo service is currently accessed using a set of shared user accounts. Contact the Nexodus team for access details.

Soon we plan to expand access to this service to include authentication with GitHub. This page will be updated when that is available.

## Setup Instructions

Instructions for how to get your devices connected to the service are available on the admin UI dashboard once you log in.
