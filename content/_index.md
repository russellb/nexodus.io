## Why Nexodus

Nexodus ensures people can spend less time worrying about connectivity across disparate types of infrastructure.

* **Hybrid Infrastructure Connectivity** - Provide secure connectivity with consistent addressing without having to worry about differences among locations or accounting for changes if the device moves to a new location. Circumvent NAT and Firewall challenges to provide secure connectivity to the specific devices you require, regardless of where they are.
* **Compliance** - Provide isolated connectivity among a set of nodes, even if they are running across multiple network administrative domains.
* **Open Source** - All of Nexodus is Open Source. The clients, control plane, and all support of service operations are available under the Apache License Version 2.0.

## Features

This project implements IP connectivity-as-a-service that provides secure, isolated connectivity across any type of infrastructure. A sample of its feature include

* **Custom Authentication** - Nexodus uses OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication, allowing you to choose from a broad ecosystem of OIDC providers.
* **Optimized Connectivity** - Nexodus provides direct, mesh connectivity wherever possible, even in places where NAT or firewalls would typically prevent it.
* **Security** - Traffic is encrypted using Wireguard without the service requiring access to any device's traffic.
* **IP Mobility** - Devices connected to Nexodus get a consistent IP address that moves with them.
